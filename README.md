  <h2>About</h2>
  <h4>This project is for people who love to write and share them online. There is no word limits, so you can write without worrying about 
    
  word limit. Web security is used so no one can see the email address of the user, and user password has been hashed which is one way encryption. So it cant be decrypted.
